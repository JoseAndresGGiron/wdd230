            <p> Amazon is one of the sites I use the most for my online purchases. Amazon sells all kinds of products,
                and every product can be color different from each other, each product has a preview image about it. Can
                you imagine how hard is to contrast products of all kinds of colors? However, colors make a good
                contrast making the elements look different from each other while the site looks clean.</p>

            <p>This is the website for Guatemalan reseller company that sells Apple products. This website looks clean
                and improves drives focus because it has right amount of white space between its elements.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I enjoy the pandora website because everything is very well aligned. We can see the available products as
                a list. Everything looks very neat. There is a certain amount of space within each element. I have made
                some purchases through this website. Since it's very aligned purchasing has been so easy while searching
                for my product, comparing between different products, and finally, purchasing what I was looking for.
